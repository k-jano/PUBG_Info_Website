                                <p>The Erangel map is the base map for the game. It's pocked with small croppings of buildings, each with a good distance between them, necessitating the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area. A red circle will result in bombing. Along side of adapting to red zones and the circle, Erangel has different weather each time you play in which you have to adapt your shooting, visibility and tactics. </p>
                                <p>In order to make your best use of this map, you really need to be aware of where the players often congregate. Any groupings of three or more buildings can be a huge choke point where a lot of players are at, meaning you could die really fast. When clearing areas, make sure you approach in prone and without openly firing - this will help hide your location. </p>
                                <p>Additionally, take your time clearing buildings. It's much easier to move through buildings one room at a time, clearing each, than it is to run through trying to get everything as fast as you can with the hope of not wiping. Remember - it's better to get poor gear and live than it is to get great gear and die immediately. </p>
                                <p>The name Erangel was chosen because PLAYERUNKNOWN's daughter is called Eryn.</p>

                                <p>Erangel is a fictional island in the black sea abandoned near Russia where a military occupation was controlling it. The military occupation tested chemical/biological experiments on the islands population. After a resistance attack on a biological facility, the island had to be abandoned </p>
                                <p>Erangel was originally occupied by Soviet forces from the 1950â€™s onwards and was used as a military testing facility, which explains the military base as well as the hospital and storage facilities. A local resistance movement fought to reclaim the island which eventually lead to the island becoming abandoned. The electrical field that you see wreaking havoc on the island is powered by electrical emitters which were used to contain towns that were showing signs of revolting against the Soviet forces.</p>

                                <p>Miramar offers it's unique terrain and dense urban areas. You can find slums and a canyon with a river running through it on the south end, as well as villages throughout the city with destroyed bridges. The city is protected from outsiders (along side keeping players inside) with huge mountains and walls protecting the borders. Miramar will create a new Battle Royale experience where the old strategies from Erangel may no longer work and new tactics are required.  </p>

                                <p>Sanhok is the first map that the art team of PUBG Corp visited a location specifically for world art development. By physically being in the jungles and mountains in a humid Asian country, it not only made them imagine what the new map will play like, but they felt the breeze, smelled the air and heard the sounds. All of these experiences are helping the team create a unique map experience.   </p>
                                <p>The map is inspired by a wide variety of islands in Thailand and the Philippines, the PUBG Art team; comprised of Technical Artists, Concept Artists and 3D Environment Artists, they took photos (Photogrammetry) to capture the island then transfer that to the game engine to design Sanhok   </p>
